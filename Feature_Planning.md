# React Calculator Development Plan

This document outlines the proposed features for implementation in the React calculator project.

---

## Feature 1: Scientific Functions

### User Story
As a user, I want to use advanced functions like square root, powers, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), and constants (π, e) so I can perform scientific calculations.

### Technical Requirements
* Add new buttons for `sqrt`, `x²`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`, `π`, `e`.
* Update calculator logic to handle these operations using built-in `Math` functions.
* Display results correctly, including decimals.

### Files Likely to be Modified
`App.js`, `Calculator.js`, and possibly `CSS` files.

### Potential Challenges
* Correctly parsing input when mixing advanced and basic operations.
* Rounding floating-point results.

## Feature 2: Calculation History

### User Story
As a user, I want to see a history of my previous calculations so I can review and reuse them.

### Technical Requirements
* Maintain an array of past calculations in state.
* Display the history below the calculator.
* Add a "Clear History" button to reset the list.
* Create a new component to format and display the history.

### Files Likely to be Modified
`App.js`, `Calculator.js`, and a new component like `History.js`.

### Potential Challenges
* Ensuring history updates correctly after each calculation.
* Avoiding UI clutter.

## Feature 3: Error Handling

### User Story
As a user, I want the calculator to display errors (e.g., "Division by zero") instead of crashing or showing invalid results.

### Technical Requirements
* Check for division by zero and other invalid operations.
* Set a maximum digit limit (e.g., 12 digits).
* Display error messages on the screen instead of `NaN` or `Infinity`.

### Files Likely to be Modified
`Calculator.js`, `App.js`.

### Potential Challenges
* Handling edge cases consistently.
* Avoiding breaking existing logic.
